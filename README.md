# What does the Program do?
This program will take as input a sample set of data that the NIDS has processed concerning the likely threat of each packet. The program then processes the set of threat samples and determines if there is a likely breach. The output from the program reports if it detects a breach in the sample set of data or that this set does not contain a sign of an intrusion. The program then repeats the analysis with a new set of samples. Only when the input contains an exit code does the program end.

# How to run
To run the program you can either manually type the input in the command line or pipe in a input file.
